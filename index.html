        <h1>ABOUT THE BAND</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to the electrifying world of Myst, an alternative rock band
          led by a forceful lineup of talented women. With our debut album,
          Without, we're ready to set the music scene ablaze, fusing captivating
          melodies, poetic lyrics, and raw energy into an unforgettable sonic
          experience. Rooted in the rich legacy of alternative rock, our music
          embodies a fearless spirit, challenging conventions and embracing
          individuality. Through our songs, we explore themes of loss,
          resilience, and the power of self-discovery.
          <br />
          As a woman-led band, we are here to make a statement. We stand as a
          symbol of empowerment, showing that passion, talent, and determination
          know no boundaries. Our music is a call to all who dare to dream,
          encouraging them to find their own voice and break free from the
          constraints society imposes.
          <br />
          Welcome to the revolution. Together, let's rise and rock the world!
